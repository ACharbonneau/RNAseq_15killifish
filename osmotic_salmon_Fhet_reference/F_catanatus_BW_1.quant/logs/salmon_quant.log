[2018-02-28 11:47:28.480] [jointLog] [info] Computed 178767 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-02-28 11:47:28.480] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4239554 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 11:47:28.488] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00172989% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.


[2018-02-28 11:47:28.496] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4239554 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
