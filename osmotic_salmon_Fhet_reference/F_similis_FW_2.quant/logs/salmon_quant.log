[2018-02-28 12:30:51.459] [jointLog] [info] Computed 176892 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-02-28 12:30:51.459] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4711815 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 12:30:51.474] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00149056% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.


[2018-02-28 12:30:51.486] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4711815 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
