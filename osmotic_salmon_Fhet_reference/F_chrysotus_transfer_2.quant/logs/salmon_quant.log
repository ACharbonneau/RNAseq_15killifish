[2018-02-28 12:18:26.611] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11698038 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 12:18:26.634] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000615426% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
