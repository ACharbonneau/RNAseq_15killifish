[2018-02-28 12:23:55.716] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7321209 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 12:23:55.736] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000935741% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
