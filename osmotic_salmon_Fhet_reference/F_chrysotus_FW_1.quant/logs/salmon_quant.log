[2018-02-28 11:57:53.785] [jointLog] [info] Counted 8206089 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 11:57:53.806] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000762316% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
