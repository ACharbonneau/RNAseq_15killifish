==================
Observed 17991052 total fragments (17991052 in most recent round)

[2018-03-07 12:21:52.524] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000511365% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
