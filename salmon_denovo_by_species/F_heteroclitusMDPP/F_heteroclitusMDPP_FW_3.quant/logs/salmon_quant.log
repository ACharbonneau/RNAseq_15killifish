[2018-03-07 11:53:42.411] [jointLog] [info] Counted 14174552 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-07 11:53:42.452] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000780702% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
