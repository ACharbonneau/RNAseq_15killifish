[2018-03-07 11:44:42.357] [jointLog] [info] Counted 14762245 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-07 11:44:42.394] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000669176% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
