[2018-03-07 11:48:24.326] [jointLog] [info] Counted 30997262 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-07 11:48:24.385] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00066942% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
