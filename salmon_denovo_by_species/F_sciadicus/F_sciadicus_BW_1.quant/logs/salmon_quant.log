[2018-03-07 11:38:25.354] [jointLog] [info] Counted 23127985 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-07 11:38:25.506] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000459143% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
