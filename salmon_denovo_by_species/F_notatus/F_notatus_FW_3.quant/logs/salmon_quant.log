==================
Observed 18507786 total fragments (18507786 in most recent round)

[2018-03-07 11:58:15.596] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000675391% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
