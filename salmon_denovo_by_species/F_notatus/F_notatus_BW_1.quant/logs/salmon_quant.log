==================
Observed 31996438 total fragments (31996438 in most recent round)

[2018-03-07 11:28:52.074] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000734457% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
