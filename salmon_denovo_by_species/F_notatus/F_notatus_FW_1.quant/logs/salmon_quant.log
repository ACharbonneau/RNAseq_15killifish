==================
Observed 8889846 total fragments (8889846 in most recent round)

[2018-03-07 11:49:16.458] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00574813% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
