[2018-03-07 11:27:39.238] [jointLog] [info] Counted 13048667 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-07 11:27:39.260] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000548468% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
