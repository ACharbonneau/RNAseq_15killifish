[2018-03-07 11:40:59.228] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16017305 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-07 11:40:59.253] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000405921% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
