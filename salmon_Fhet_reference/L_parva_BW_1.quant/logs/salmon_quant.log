[2018-02-28 11:43:05.706] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7076641 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 11:43:05.731] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00134239% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
