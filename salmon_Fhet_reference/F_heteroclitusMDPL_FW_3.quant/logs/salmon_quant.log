[2018-02-28 11:58:35.350] [jointLog] [info] Counted 12203982 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 11:58:35.365] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000509159% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
