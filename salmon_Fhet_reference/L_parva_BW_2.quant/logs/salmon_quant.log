[2018-02-28 11:47:13.746] [jointLog] [info] Counted 5520487 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-02-28 11:47:13.762] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00172233% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
