[2018-02-28 12:07:35.394] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00118286% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.


[2018-02-28 12:07:35.406] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4881434 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
